#CONDITIONALS (AKA if statements)
# if some condition (called boolean condition) is true, then execute some code

x = 6
if x == 6: # == equality operator (= is assignment operator), need : at the end

    # in Python, identation (1 tab or 4 spaces) is used to group code statements into a block
    # like {} in C/C++
